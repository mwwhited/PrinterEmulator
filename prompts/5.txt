Â okay, this is a micro controller project.  you do not have virtual memory and can not over allocate RAM.  104.5% allocation is an absolutely obvious error.  
You need to do extremely aggressive memory management.  Avoid strings, use local flash as much as you can, use as much zero allocation patterns as possible, 
Limit the size of buffers.  it is very important you that you conserve RAM memory.
